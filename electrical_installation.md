Worst case for all boards is: £330.14


Emergency lighting
==================

This requires a full test to ensure that the lights run for the
required time and that there are sufficient lights for anyone to
make an emergency exit.

Note, the main area may require some more emergency lighting.

The landlord's supply currently runs the lighting on the outside
edge of the hackspace. We may want to leave this for the moment
as it is all permanently on.


Main lighting
=============

Power draw checks need to be made and then any further action can
be taken. It is possible some of the old flourescent tube fittings
will need to be replaced.

It has been noted fititng LED tubes and switches has significantly
reduced the electricity bill. Changing all tubes out should be considered
or replacing the tubes entirely in the areas where more light is required.

Changing out the two flourescent tubes in snackspace for LED ones has
reduced the power draw on the circuit from 1.5A to 0.2A (measured by
current-clamp meter) which shows significant improvement. Note, one of
the tubes was already dying and needed to be replaced due to repeated
failures to start.


Main toilet
===========

The emergency alarm has been fitted and needs final test. It is possible
an second sounder in the main area will be added before completion.

There are 1 or 2 32W LED panels the same as the back of the stage to
be fitted to provide lighting. The LED panels have been purchased.

If extraction is required a switched/fuse will need to be fitted and
appropriate fan isolation. This should not require extra expense apart
from the purchase of a suitable extraction fan.


Water heater
============

There is a 2.5kW water heater which is intended to provide hot water
to the classroom area, the main toilet and possibly also the green
room sink.

This will need a separate supply and fused connection unit. We should
have the connection parts, but will need enough cable.

The location for this will need to be determined, but it could be put
in the area above the green room as it is close to water and electrical
feed.

Notes, do we need to put copper pipe on the in/out and earth bond this
to the main earth feed?

*Adam D. Horden - earthing to be discussed after initial testing under
BS7671 and measurements taken to determine earthing requirements.*

Class room
==========

To finalise the electrical plans for this concrete designs are needed.

Current assumptions are:

Feed the lighting from the same supply that goes to the main toilet,
via a conduit that's currently already partly through the entrance
area. The actual lighting controls and feeds will depend on what sort
of lighting to put in place.

Power sockets in the dado rails (we will need some way of keeping
the sockets in the rails due to the use of. Do we also need some
sort of hanging down sockets (we do have cable baskets still around)


Class room toilet
=================

Assuming this is just going to require some sort of light with a
pull switch to turn on. No emergency alarm is planned.

todo: has this now been removed from requirements

Weldy
=====

One or two 32W LED panels the same as the back of the stage.
The LED panels have been purchased, all that required is to fit them.

There are four standard 13A double sockets to be fitted. These are
already purchased and require the time to fit them.

We have 16A and 32A C-form sockets available to fit if required.

Any other power for specific welders needs to be discussed. 3 phase
can be fitted, but will require parts.


CNC
===

This requires proper lighting on our circuit and possibly more sockets.

The current landlord lighting and emergency lighting also goes through
here. This needs to be tidied up. No further items should be required
for this work.


Woody dusty
===========

Sockets to be finished in here.

Emergency cutoff system to be fitted/specified

2 more LED light tube fittings are ready to be fitted.

Note, the "far" radial goes through here, we may require this to be
moved so that the emergency cutoff can do all the sockets in there without
removing power to that side of the space.


Other items
===========

- We will probably run out of 4mm2 cable. £105 for 100M
- We may require more lighting cable. At worst £42 for 100M
- General 20mm conduit and fittings.

- Finish sockets in weldy
- Finish dado rail sockets
- Map DB1 circuits
- Map DB2 circuits
- Woody/dusty wiring plan
- Second EM light test
- Put new EM light above double doors into classroom



Possible outgoings for materials
================================

weldy:

- should currently have sufficient materials

cnc:

- may need new light fitting for this
- to cost - isolator/fuse for extraction fan


toilet:

- should currently have materials to finish current work
- may need extraction fan and appropriate isolator

green room:

- should have all materials

slackspace:

- light fittings t.b.d

full cost will require planning on exactly what is going where w.r.t to things like lighting. 

the changes still need estimating and planning

emergency lighting:

- to be determined once EM lights are tested


general:

- 100M of 1.5mm2 single cables for lighting (4x£13.62) = £54.88
- 100M of 4mm2 single cables for sockets (3x£35.40) = £106.20
- May need some more 20mm conduit (£1.47 per 3M)
- Misc conduit fittings (usually <£1 each)


Future spending
===============

Some of these items will depend on the

- Replacement of existing flourescent tubes with LEDs - to be discussed
- Wiring of "classroom" - depends on what is needed

There may be more cable required, see cabling costs above. Possible £150

The RCBOs for the two DBs have been acquired off ebay, costs were:
£60, £23.90, £22.90, £15.35, £26.96 = £152. This under half the original
estimate for RCBOs that are better quality that originally specified.


November / December:

- Replacement EM light for above arts, and an extra above ramp, approx £100
- RCBO fitting to DB2, about £120 (already got most of this from ebay)



Installation standards
======================

lighting is 1.5mm conduit singles, in the following colours:
- green/yellow earth
- brown is either live or swithced live
- grey is switched live
- black for emergency live
- blue with black end tape emergency neutral

note, some of the old EM lighting is run on 1mm2 tripple, this uses:

- brown for live
- grey for neutral
- black for emergency live


near is near the outside wall
far is the one further from the outside wall



Metal fittings for phase 1 completion
=====================================

The conduit for the lighting needs metal cable saddles fitting every 60cm
for any bit which is above an area that people might move about.

Metal saddles are Screwfix code 5577J

(Conduit is the round white plastic tubing with wires in it)

Notes:
- We do not need metal saddles on the runs down the sockets or light switches
- The area in arts by the new electrical board has useful bits in it
  - 5x40 screws and the red plugs to go with them
  - Metal saddles (around 25 at current count, will go get more)
- The red plugs and screws go with a 5-6mm dril
  - The plaster work isn't great, this can be drilled with a standard HSS...
- We only have a couple of ladders capable of reaching the cross beams
- The big yellow spirit level has a measure on the top


The large black SWA cabling currenly fixed onto the bottom of the trunking
also is going to require extra fixing with metal ties. These will should be
fitted between the existing black clamps (preferably middled).

Ties should be secured into the trunking using M5x12 bolts through the clamp
bases. When drilling into trunking, place some wood between drill area and
any wires to avoid issues with drilling into cable (this is bad).

Metal ties and bases are on order, and will be in for Saturday 25th. There
is a pack of M5x12 bolts and M5 nuts on the area described above for the
other supplies.



Meeting agenda, May 2020
========================

- any further splitting of the lighting
  - have now purhased 10A RCBO for DB
- restart planning for post fire/covid
- asbestos issues
- woody sockets
- woody emergency stop
